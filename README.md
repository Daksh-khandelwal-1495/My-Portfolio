Hello Guys ! Welcome to my repository. 
This is the first portfolio website I made involving some basic HTML,CSS and a bit of typescript. 
THis portfolio includes the following:
1.Dual Layout for introduction and picture.
2.Typescript animation for my designation and interest that works as the site loads. 
3. A tabular structure to denote my work experience and education. 
4. Footer: Contact details.
